JavaScript Effects / Animations:

1. Audio Feature - I have created an audio feature which user can turn on and off by simply clicking the
pokeball that can be found below the sub-title of Pokemon Gallery (Second Page of HTML || Main project content).

2. A transition in the pokemon.html was added which reveals the title heading whenever page is already rendered.

3. A slight elevation of Home page cards to create a slight highlight when card is hovered. It would showcase
the pokemon inside the card.

4. A wave effect in main page showing the title of featured pokemons to have a wave effect. It is done to create
uniqueness among other elements.

5. To have a astonishing effect, I have also added a pulse effect in the Pokedex Page exactly at its heading.

6. A bounce effect is then added in the Pokedex page (All pokemons page) to emphasize them and allows user to 
appreciate the pokemon even more.
